## 💰 **Timeline-Based Pricing Power**

### **The "Time Value Equation"**

| Scenario | Their Option | Your Offer | Client Saves |
|----------|--------------|------------|--------------|
| **Restaurant needs website for summer season** | Agency: 12 weeks (misses season) | You: 3 weeks + rush = 10 days | 10 weeks + their season |
| **Plumber's website is down** | Freelancer: "I can start in 2 weeks" | You: 48-hour emergency | Lost customers |
| **New business launch** | DIY: 40+ hours of their time | You: 2 weeks hands-off | 40 hours + professional result |

### **ROI Pitch:**
"Every week without a professional website costs you approximately 5-10 leads. My 2-week delivery means you're capturing leads 4-10 weeks faster than with other providers. That's 20-100 extra leads worth $10,000-50,000 in potential business."
