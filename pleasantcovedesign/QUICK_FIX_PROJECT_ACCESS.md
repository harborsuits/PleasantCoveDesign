# 🚨 Quick Fix: Project Access Issue

## The Problem:
Your Squarespace module tried to connect to `api.pleasantcovedesign.com` which doesn't exist. Your actual API is at Railway.

## ✅ Fixed! 

### What I Changed:
```javascript
// OLD (wrong):
API_URL: 'https://api.pleasantcovedesign.com'

// NEW (correct):
API_URL: 'https://pcd-production-clean-production-e6f3.up.railway.app'
```

## 📋 To Access Your Project:

You entered `ben04537@gmail.com` but **no project exists for that email yet**.

### Create a Project First:

1. **Open your admin dashboard**
2. **Go to Leads** (or Dashboard)
3. **Create a new company:**
   - Name: Your Name (or Test Company)
   - Email: `ben04537@gmail.com` ← MUST MATCH!
   - Phone: (optional)

4. **Create a project for that company:**
   - Click "Create Project" 
   - Add project details
   - Save

5. **Return to Squarespace** - your project will appear!

## 🎯 Important:
- The customer module **views existing projects**
- It does **NOT create new projects**
- Projects must be created in admin UI first
- Email must match EXACTLY

## 🔧 Alternative: Use a Test Project

If you already have test projects:
1. Check what email they use in admin UI
2. Use that email instead of your personal one
3. Or update the test project's company email to yours

## 📝 Updated Files:
- `SQUARESPACE_MODULE_PRODUCTION.html` - Fixed API URL and improved error messages

Copy the updated module code to Squarespace and try again!
