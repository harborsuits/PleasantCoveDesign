# 🔧 Solution: Your Project Access Issue

## 🚨 What Happened:

1. **Wrong API URL**: Module was trying to connect to `api.pleasantcovedesign.com` (doesn't exist)
2. **No Project Found**: You entered `ben04537@gmail.com` but no project exists for that email

## ✅ What I Fixed:

### 1. **Corrected the API URL**
```javascript
// Was pointing to:
API_URL: 'https://api.pleasantcovedesign.com' ❌

// Now points to your Railway API:
API_URL: 'https://pcd-production-clean-production-e6f3.up.railway.app' ✅
```

### 2. **Better Error Messages**
Now shows helpful instructions when no project is found.

## 📋 How to Make It Work:

### Option 1: Create a Project for Your Email

1. **Open your admin dashboard**
2. **Create a company:**
   ```
   Name: Ben Dickinson (or any name)
   Email: ben04537@gmail.com  ← MUST MATCH EXACTLY
   Phone: (optional)
   ```
3. **Create a project:**
   - Click "Create Project" on that company
   - Fill in project details
   - Save
4. **Copy the updated module** to Squarespace
5. **Try again** - it will work!

### Option 2: Use an Existing Project

1. **Check your admin dashboard** for existing projects
2. **Note the email** associated with a project
3. **Use that email** instead of your personal one

## 🎯 Key Points:

- **Projects must be created in admin first**
- **Email must match EXACTLY**
- **The module VIEWS projects, doesn't CREATE them**
- **Your messaging widget works because it creates conversations automatically**

## 🚀 Quick Test:

1. Update the module in Squarespace with the fixed code
2. Create a test project with your email
3. Access it - should work immediately!

## 💡 Pro Tip:

Since you're testing, create a project with:
- Company Email: `ben04537@gmail.com`
- Project Name: "Test Project"
- Some sample billing data

Then you can fully test all features!
