# üö® URGENT: Deploy Fix for Squarespace Module

## The Problem:
Your Squarespace module can't create projects because the new endpoint isn't on Railway yet!

## Quick Fix Options:

### Option 1: Deploy to Railway Now (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Add and commit the new file
git add SQUARESPACE_CUSTOMER_PROJECT_LIFECYCLE.md
git commit -m "Add customer project lifecycle docs"

# 2. Push to Railway
git push harborsuits main --force

# 3. Wait 2-3 minutes for Railway to deploy

# 4. Test your Squarespace module again!
```

### Option 2: Test Locally First
1. Make sure your local server is running:
   ```bash
   cd pleasantcovedesign/server
   npm start
   ```

2. Update the Squarespace module to use localhost:
   - Find this line in your code (around line 726):
   ```javascript
   API_URL: window.location.hostname === 'localhost' 
     ? 'http://localhost:3000' 
     : 'https://pcd-production-clean-production-e6f3.up.railway.app',
   ```
   
   - Temporarily change to:
   ```javascript
   API_URL: 'http://localhost:3000',  // Force local for testing
   ```

3. Test entering ben04537@gmail.com

### Option 3: Manual Database Entry
If you need it working RIGHT NOW while deploying:

1. Use your admin UI:
   - Go to Clients ‚Üí Add Client
   - Email: ben04537@gmail.com
   - Create a project for them

2. This will work immediately!

## üéØ What the Fix Does:

The new endpoint (`/api/projects/member/:email/find-or-create`) will:
- Check if client exists ‚Üí create if not
- Check if they have ACTIVE project ‚Üí create if not
- Return the project data
- Auto-login to project workspace

## üìç After Deploying:

Your flow will work exactly like the messenger:
1. Customer enters email once
2. Sees their project
3. You see it in your admin
4. Everything syncs in real-time

**Just run the deploy command above and it'll work!** üöÄ
