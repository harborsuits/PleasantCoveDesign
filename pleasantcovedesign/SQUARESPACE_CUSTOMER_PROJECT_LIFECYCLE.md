# 🔄 Customer Project Lifecycle - How It Should Work

## The Vision (Just Like Messenger)

### 1️⃣ First Time Customer
```
Customer enters: ben04537@gmail.com
↓
System checks: "Is there a client profile?"
- NO → Create new client profile
- YES → Use existing profile
↓
System checks: "Is there an ACTIVE project?"
- NO → Create new project
- YES → Show existing project
```

### 2️⃣ Ongoing Project
```
Customer logs in with same email
↓
Shows their ACTIVE project:
- Overview with billing
- Design Canvas (view designs, leave feedback)
- Milestones (track progress)
- Files (download deliverables)
- Messages (same as messenger widget)
```

### 3️⃣ Project Completion
```
You (in admin) mark project "Complete" or "Archive"
↓
Project status = archived
↓
Customer can still view it (read-only)
```

### 4️⃣ New Project (Same Customer)
```
Customer logs in again after project archived
↓
System sees: "No ACTIVE project"
↓
Creates NEW project (Project #2)
↓
But still linked to same client profile!
```

## 🎯 The Key Points:

1. **One Email = One Client Forever**
   - All projects link to this client
   - All messages link to this client
   - Complete history maintained

2. **Active vs Archived Projects**
   - Only ONE active project at a time
   - Completed projects = archived
   - New login after archive = new project

3. **Everything Links Together**
   ```
   Client Profile (ben04537@gmail.com)
   ├── Project 1 (archived) - Website 2023
   ├── Project 2 (archived) - Redesign 2024
   ├── Project 3 (active) - Current Work
   ├── All Messages (from messenger)
   └── All History
   ```

## 🚨 Current Issue:

The auto-create endpoint isn't on Railway yet. You need to:

1. **Deploy the latest code** to Railway
2. **OR** Test locally first

## 📝 What Happens in Your Admin UI:

When customer creates account via Squarespace:
- ✅ New client appears in "Clients" tab
- ✅ New project appears in "Project Workspace"
- ✅ You can manage everything from there
- ✅ Real-time updates both ways

Just like the messenger, but for full project management!
