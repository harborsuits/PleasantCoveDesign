## ðŸ§© Component Dependencies

### What Depends on What:

```
Database (SQLite)
    â†‘ Used by everything
    
Scrapers
    â†“ Feeds into
Lead Service
    â†“ Used by
Admin UI + Outreach Manager
    
Demo Generator
    â†‘ Called by
Outreach Manager
    â†“ Tracks with
Analytics Service

Order Service
    â†“ Triggers
Stripe Integration
    â†“ Creates
Project Service

Client Portal
```

---

## ðŸ”§ Key Integration Points

### 1. Database as Central Hub
- All components read/write here
- Single source of truth
- Real-time updates via polling

### 2. API Routes as Controllers
- Handle business logic
- Validate data
- Coordinate components

### 3. Background Services
- Scrapers run independently
- Outreach processes queues
- Demos generate on-demand

### 4. UI as View Layer
- Reflects database state
- Initiates actions
- Shows real-time feedback

## ðŸ’¡ How to Test Component Interactions

### Test Lead Flow:
```bash
# 1. Start a scrape
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/scrape-runs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"city":"Portland","category":"plumber","limit":10}'

# 2. Check progress
curl http://localhost:3001/api/scrape-runs/[RUN_ID]

# 3. View leads
curl http://localhost:3001/api/companies
```

### Test Outreach:
```bash
# Launch campaign to one lead
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/bot/outreach/123 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Test Order Creation:
```bash
# Create order
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/orders \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"companyId":123,"package":"growth","total":3888}'
```

## ðŸš¨ Critical Component Relationships

### Must Work Together:
1. **Scraper + Database** - No leads without this
2. **Leads + Scoring** - Prioritization is key
3. **Outreach + Tracking** - Need to measure success
4. **Orders + Stripe** - Revenue collection
5. **Projects + Portal** - Client experience

### Can Work Independently:
1. **Demo Generator** - On-demand service
2. **Analytics** - Read-only reporting
3. **Minerva** - Optional automation
4. **File Storage** - Separate concern

This is how your components actually talk to each other in production!
