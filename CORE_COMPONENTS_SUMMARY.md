## 💡 How It All Works Together

```
Find (Scraper) → Score (Algorithm) → Contact (Outreach) → 
Convert (Sales) → Deliver (Portal) → Profit 💰
```

### Real Example:
1. Scraper finds "Bob's Plumbing" - no website
2. System scores it 95/100 (🔥 Hot lead)
3. Sends SMS with personalized demo
4. Bob views demo, fills contact form
5. You send quote, Bob pays $3,888
6. Project created, freelancer builds site
