# 🎯 Scraper Optimization Guide - Maximizing Lead Quality

## Current Scraper Performance Analysis

### What's Working Well:
```
✅ Finding 20-50 businesses per search

## 🚀 Optimizing Scraper Performance

### 1. **Smart Search Queries**

Instead of generic searches, use targeted queries:

```python
# BASIC (Less Effective):
"plumbers in Portland, ME"

# OPTIMIZED (More Targeted):
queries = [
    "plumbers near me Portland Maine",
    "emergency plumber Portland ME", 
    "drain cleaning Portland Maine",
    "water heater repair Portland ME",
    "{service} {city} {state} -yelp -yellowpages"  # Excludes directories
]
```

### 2. **Location Strategy**

Target locations strategically:

```python
# LOCATION PRIORITIES:
location_strategy = {
    "tier_1": [  # Best ROI
        "Suburbs of major cities",
        "Towns 10-50k population",
        "County seats"
    ],
    "tier_2": [  # Good potential
        "Tourist areas",
        "Growing communities",
        "Business districts"
    ],
    "avoid": [  # Lower ROI
        "Major city centers (saturated)",
        "Towns under 5k (too small)",
        "Tech hubs (they have websites)"
    ]
}
```

### 3. **Industry Targeting**

Best industries for no-website businesses:

```python
HIGH_CONVERSION_INDUSTRIES = {
    "home_services": {
        "searches": ["plumber", "electrician", "handyman", "painter", 
                    "carpenter", "locksmith", "appliance repair"],
        "conversion_rate": "15-25%",
        "avg_project_value": "$2,500-4,500"
    },
    
    "health_wellness": {
        "searches": ["massage therapist", "chiropractor", "acupuncture",
                    "physical therapy", "counselor", "nutritionist"],
        "conversion_rate": "10-20%", 
        "avg_project_value": "$3,000-5,000"
    },
    
    "local_services": {
        "searches": ["auto repair", "lawn care", "pet grooming",
                    "dry cleaner", "alterations", "shoe repair"],
        "conversion_rate": "12-18%",
        "avg_project_value": "$2,000-3,500"
    },
    
    "specialty_food": {
        "searches": ["food truck", "caterer", "bakery", "meal prep",
                    "specialty grocery", "butcher shop"],
        "conversion_rate": "8-15%",
        "avg_project_value": "$2,500-4,000"
    }
}
```

### 4. **Quality Scoring Algorithm**

Implement lead scoring to prioritize outreach:

```python
def calculate_lead_score(business):
    score = 0
    
    # Website status (most important)
    if not business['has_website']:
        score += 40
    
    # Google presence
    if business['rating'] >= 4.5:
        score += 20
    elif business['rating'] >= 4.0:
        score += 15
    
    # Review count (established business)
    if business['review_count'] >= 50:
        score += 20
    elif business['review_count'] >= 20:
        score += 15
    elif business['review_count'] >= 10:
        score += 10
    
    # Contact info
    if business['phone']:
        score += 10
    
    # Business hours (active business)
    if business['hours']:
        score += 5
    
    # Industry multiplier
    if business['category'] in HIGH_VALUE_INDUSTRIES:
        score *= 1.5
    
    return score

# Lead categories:
# 90-100: 🔥 HOT - Contact immediately
# 70-89:  🎯 WARM - Contact within 24h
# 50-69:  💡 COOL - Add to nurture campaign
# <50:    ❄️  COLD - Low priority
```

## 📊 Scraper Enhancement Implementation

### 1. **Add Email Discovery**

Current scrapers don't find emails well. Add this:

```python
def enhance_with_email(business):
    """Try multiple methods to find email"""
    
    email_finders = [
        # 1. Check Google result description
        check_google_description,
        
        # 2. Facebook page scraping
        check_facebook_page,
        
        # 3. Common patterns
        generate_common_patterns,  # info@, contact@, firstname@
        
        # 4. Hunter.io API (paid but worth it)
        check_hunter_io,
        
        # 5. Local directories
        check_local_directories
    ]
    
    for finder in email_finders:
        email = finder(business)
        if email and validate_email(email):
            return email
    
    return None
```

### 2. **Add Competitor Intelligence**

Know their competition = better sales pitch:

```python
def analyze_competition(business, location):
    """Find their competitors with websites"""
    
    competitors = scrape_similar_businesses(
        business['category'], 
        location,
        has_website=True  # Only competitors WITH websites
    )
    
    competition_insights = {
        'total_competitors': len(competitors),
        'with_websites': sum(1 for c in competitors if c['has_website']),
        'avg_rating': avg([c['rating'] for c in competitors]),
        'top_competitor': max(competitors, key=lambda x: x['review_count'])
    }
    
    # Use in outreach:
    # "3 of your competitors in Portland already have websites..."
    # "Don't let {top_competitor} steal all the online customers"
    
    return competition_insights
```

### 3. **Add Business Intelligence**

Gather more data for personalization:

```python
def gather_business_intelligence(business):
    """Deep dive on each business"""
    
    intel = {
        # Years in business (check copyright, "since", established)
        'years_in_business': extract_years_in_business(),
        
        # Busy times (from Google)
        'peak_hours': get_popular_times(),
        
        # Services offered (from reviews)
        'services': extract_services_from_reviews(),
        
        # Price range
        'price_level': get_price_level(),
        
        # Photos available
        'has_photos': check_google_photos(),
        
        # Social media presence
        'facebook_page': find_facebook_page(),
        'instagram': find_instagram_account()
    }
    
    return intel
```
