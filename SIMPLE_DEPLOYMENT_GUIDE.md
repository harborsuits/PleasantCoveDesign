## 🎯 Deploy to Railway (One-Click)

### Option 1: Railway Dashboard
1. Go to your Railway project
2. Click your service
3. Go to **Settings** → **Deploy**
4. Click **Redeploy**

## 🌐 Access Your Admin UI

Once deployed, your Admin UI lives at:
```
https://your-railway-service.up.railway.app/leads
```

Replace `your-railway-service` with your actual Railway URL.

### Example URLs:
- Dashboard: `https://your-railway-service.up.railway.app/dashboard`
- Leads: `https://your-railway-service.up.railway.app/leads`
- Inbox: `https://your-railway-service.up.railway.app/inbox`
- Settings: `https://your-railway-service.up.railway.app/settings`

## 🔄 Making Updates

When you change the Admin UI:

```bash
# From the root directory
./build-and-deploy-admin.sh

# Then redeploy to Railway
cd pleasantcovedesign/server
railway up
```

Or use the all-in-one command:
```bash
cd pleasantcovedesign/server
npm run build:with-admin
railway up
```

## ✅ That's it!

- **One URL** for everything
- **No more localhost**
- **Automatic updates** when you redeploy
- **Works from anywhere**

Your Railway URL is now your permanent Admin UI address! 🎊
