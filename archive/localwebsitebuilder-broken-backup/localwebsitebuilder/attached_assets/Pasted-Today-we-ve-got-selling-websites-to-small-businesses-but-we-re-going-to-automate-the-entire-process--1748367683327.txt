Today we've got selling websites to small businesses but we're going to automate the entire process and do none of the work ourselves. So first up I went to the map and picked a random regional town in my home country of Australia. Then I googled businesses in that area. I started with mechanics, electricians, and plumbers. Then I used my data scraper to pull all of this information straight from Google. This took me a few minutes to pull around 160 businesses but you could do this for even longer From there I just put all the info on a spreadsheet and cleaned the data, making sure to remove every business that already had a website. And just like that we've got 23 businesses that literally do not have a website. Now it's time to automate our outreach. I got ChatGPT to cram in a simple JSON file and imported this straight into N8. The automation I made is super simple. It basically just grabs the mobile number from the spreadsheet you saw earlier and sends a text message using Twilio. The test went through perfectly, now all I need to do is blast these messages out, see how many calls I can book, and try and close these guys on a new website. I'll charge around $400 to build the initial site and then pay somebody on Fiverr to do it for $50. On top of that we'll have a $50 upkeep fee which will cover the domain and web hosting with some money to spend. If you want to see how you can do this for yourself I'm going to be posting a full course in my WAP community along with all the tools and automations I use. So just come and check it out.   i would like help doing this in my area of midcoast Maine. so how do we go about doing this
