# 🔧 Two Issues Fixed - Status Update

## 1️⃣ Admin UI Error: `/api/public/project/null` ✅

### What was wrong:
- Projects without access tokens were trying to open with `null`
- Admin UI was using the wrong endpoint

### What I fixed:
- Changed navigation to use project IDs instead of tokens
- Updated the API calls to use admin endpoints
- Now handles missing tokens gracefully

### To apply this fix:
1. **Restart your admin UI**
   ```bash
   cd pleasantcovedesign/admin-ui
   npm start
   ```
2. **Hard refresh** your browser (Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Projects should now open correctly!

### Optional: Fix old projects with missing tokens
```bash
node FIX_PROJECT_TOKENS.js
```
This will add tokens to any projects that don't have them.

## 2️⃣ Squarespace Module: Auto-Create Projects 🚀

### What's deployed:
- New endpoint: `/api/projects/member/:email/find-or-create`
- Auto-creates client + project when email entered
- Works like messenger widget

### Status:
- ✅ Code deployed to Railway (3 minutes ago)
- ⏳ Railway should be done building by now
- 🔍 Check your Railway dashboard for green checkmark

### Test it:
1. Go to your Squarespace page
2. Enter `ben04537@gmail.com`
3. Should now:
   - Create client profile
   - Create project
   - Show workspace!

## 🎯 Quick Check:

### For Admin UI:
- Can you open projects now? (after restart)
- No more `/null` errors?

### For Squarespace:
- Does entering email create project?
- Can you see new project in admin?

Both issues should be fixed now! Let me know if either still has problems. 🚀
