# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: DO NOT MODIFY ANYTHING IN THIS DIRECTORY ðŸš¨

## This is the GOLDEN BACKUP of the WORKING messaging widget

### What's Working:
âœ… Private member conversations (each member has their own conversation)
âœ… File uploads (photos, documents)
âœ… Files persist after refresh (no more "undefined")
âœ… Offline messages received when logging in
âœ… Real-time messaging
âœ… Session management (different users don't see each other's messages)

### Critical Files:
- `WORKING_WIDGET_*.html` - The complete working messaging widget
- DO NOT EDIT, MOVE, OR DELETE THESE FILES

### If Something Breaks:
1. STOP immediately
2. Copy the latest WORKING_WIDGET file back to `client-widget/messaging-widget-unified.html`
3. Restart the server

### Key Features That Must Be Preserved:
1. **Session Detection Logic** (lines 755-830) - Detects current member BEFORE restoring session
2. **File Upload Handling** (line 2352) - Uses `message || ''` to prevent "undefined"
3. **Message Display** (line 2238) - Checks for "undefined" string and hides empty content
4. **LoadMessages** (line 2110) - Uses `addMessageToUI` not `displayMessage`

### Working Endpoints:
- Authentication: `/api/token`
- Messages: `/api/public/project/{token}/messages`
- File uploads: FormData to same endpoint

### DO NOT:
- Change the authentication flow
- Modify session storage keys
- Alter the message display logic
- Touch the file upload handling
- Switch between `displayMessage` and `addMessageToUI`
