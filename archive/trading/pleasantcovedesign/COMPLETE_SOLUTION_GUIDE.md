# ✅ Complete Solution for Both Issues

## Issue 1: Project Management Features "Missing"

### 🎯 They're in the WORKSPACE page!

1. **Go to:** Admin Dashboard → **Workspace** (in sidebar)
2. **NOT:** Dashboard, Clients, or Leads pages

### What you'll see in Workspace:
- 🔍 **Search bar** - Find projects by name/email
- 🏷️ **Filter dropdown** - All/Active/Completed/Archived  
- ⋮ **Actions menu** on each card - Delete/Archive/Complete
- 📊 **Enhanced cards** showing:
  - Company name (who)
  - Creation date (when)
  - Project notes (why)
  - Progress bar
  - Last activity

## Issue 2: Squarespace Module Error

### ❌ The Problem:
```
Failed to load resource: /api/public/project/null
```

### ✅ The Fix:
1. **Copy the updated code** from `SQUARESPACE_MODULE_PRODUCTION.html`
2. **Replace** the old code in your Squarespace code block
3. **Save** the Squarespace page

### 🎯 Your Test Project is Ready:

## 📋 Quick Checklist:

### For Project Management:
- [ ] Navigate to `/workspace` (not dashboard)
- [ ] Look for search bar at top
- [ ] Click ⋮ on any project card
- [ ] See delete/archive options

### For Squarespace Module:
- [ ] Copy updated `SQUARESPACE_MODULE_PRODUCTION.html`
- [ ] Paste into Squarespace code block
- [ ] Save and refresh
- [ ] Enter: ben04537@gmail.com

## 🚀 Both Should Work Now!

The project management features have been there - just on the Workspace page, not Dashboard. And the Squarespace module needed the API URL fix we just made.
