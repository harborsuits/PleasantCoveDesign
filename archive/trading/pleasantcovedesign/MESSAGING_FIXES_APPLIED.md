# Messaging System Fixes Applied

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Images Not Displaying
**Problem**: Images were not loading due to incorrect URLs and CORS issues
**Solutions Applied**:
- Updated widget to use image proxy for all image attachments
- Fixed 24 localhost URLs in database to use production Railway URL
- Added fallback image for broken images
- Updated admin UI to use image proxy endpoint
- Image proxy endpoint at `/api/image-proxy/:filename` properly configured

### 2. ✅ Conversation Memory/Persistence
**Problem**: Conversations disappeared on refresh and showed old/dated messages
**Solutions Applied**:
- Fixed session restoration logic in widget
- Added proper token validation before restoring session
- Widget now checks localStorage for existing session before member detection
- Added `validateTokenWithBackend()` method to verify stored tokens
- Improved `validateSessionConsistency()` to handle email mismatches

### 3. ✅ Messages Not Appearing in UI
**Problem**: Messages sent from widget weren't appearing in admin UI
**Solutions Applied**:
- Fixed backend URL detection - now always uses Railway production for pleasantcovedesign.com
- Improved Socket.IO room joining with proper error handling
- Added project token validation in message reception
- Enhanced WebSocket connection with reconnection settings
- Added debug logging for room joining and message routing

## Technical Changes

### Widget Updates (`client-widget/messaging-widget-unified.html`)

1. **Backend URL Detection**:
   ```javascript
   // Now properly detects and uses Railway production
   if (window.location.hostname === 'www.pleasantcovedesign.com' || 
       window.location.hostname === 'pleasantcovedesign.com') {
       return 'https://pleasantcovedesign-production.up.railway.app';
   }
   ```

2. **Image Rendering with Proxy**:
   ```javascript
   // All images now use the proxy endpoint
   if (attachment.includes('/uploads/') || !attachment.startsWith('http')) {
       const filename = parts[parts.length - 1].split('?')[0];
       imageUrl = `${this.config.backendUrl}/api/image-proxy/${filename}`;
   }
   ```

3. **Session Persistence**:
   - Checks for existing session before member detection
   - Validates stored tokens with backend
   - Properly restores user session on refresh

4. **Socket.IO Improvements**:
   - Added reconnection configuration
   - Better room joining with success/failure callbacks
   - Project token validation for incoming messages

### Admin UI Updates (`admin-ui/src/pages/Inbox.tsx`)

1. **Image Display**:
   - Uses image proxy for all uploaded images
   - Avoids CORS issues with cross-origin images

### Database Fixes

1. **URL Corrections** (`server/fix-image-urls.ts`):
   - Fixed 24 image URLs from localhost to production Railway URL
   - All images now use HTTPS protocol
   - Removed any remaining mockcdn.com references

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test Image Display**:
   - Send an image from the widget
   - Verify it displays in both widget and admin UI
   - Check that clicking opens the full image

2. **Test Conversation Persistence**:
   - Send messages in a conversation
   - Refresh the widget page
   - Verify all messages are still visible
   - Check that you remain authenticated

3. **Test Cross-User Messaging**:
   - Log in as different Squarespace members
   - Verify each has their own conversation
   - Send messages and verify they appear in correct conversations

## Next Steps

If issues persist:
1. Check browser console for any errors
2. Verify the backend is running on Railway
3. Ensure Socket.IO connections are established
4. Check that project tokens match between widget and admin UI

## Environment Requirements

- Backend: https://pleasantcovedesign-production.up.railway.app
- Admin UI: Connected to Railway production
- Widget: Embedded on pleasantcovedesign.com
- Database: SQLite with fixed image URLs
