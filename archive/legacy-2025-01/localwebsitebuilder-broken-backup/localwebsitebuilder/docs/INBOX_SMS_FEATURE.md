# Manual SMS Sending with Preview - Inbox Feature

## Overview
This feature allows you to send pre-filled SMS messages to leads directly from the Inbox conversation view, with a preview step before sending.

## How It Works

### 1. **Automatic Message Suggestion**
When you open a conversation in the Inbox, the system automatically generates a suggested message based on:
- Lead score (â‰¥ 70 shows scheduling invitation)
- Lead stage (contacted, scraped, interested)
- Business name for personalization

### 2. **Message Templates**

**For High-Scoring Leads (Score â‰¥ 70):**
```
Hey [FirstName], it's Ben from Pleasant Cove Design. I'd love to chat about your website â€” you can book a free consultation at a time that works for you here: https://www.pleasantcovedesign.com/schedule?lead_id=123
```

**For Interested Leads:**
```
Hi [FirstName], just following up on our conversation. Ready to move forward with your website? Let me know if you have any questions or want to schedule a quick call: https://www.pleasantcovedesign.com/schedule?lead_id=123
```

**Default Message:**
```

```

## Technical Details

### API Endpoint
`POST /api/messages/send`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "leadId": 123,
  "channel": "sms",
  "body": "Your message text here"
}
```

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Message sent successfully",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-01T12:30:00.000Z"
}
```

### Activity Logging
Each sent message creates an activity entry:
- Type: `sms_sent`
- Description: `Manual SMS sent via Inbox UI: "[First 50 chars of message]..."`

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add "Customize Message" option to edit before sending
- [ ] Include message variants dropdown (follow-up, reminder, etc.)

- [ ] Track delivery status with webhook callbacks
- [ ] Add message history to conversation thread

## Integration Notes
- Currently simulates SMS sending (logs to console)
- Production requires Twilio integration in `sendSMS()` function
- Scheduling links automatically include the correct lead_id parameter
