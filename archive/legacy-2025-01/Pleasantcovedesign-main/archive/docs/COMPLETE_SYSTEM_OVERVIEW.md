## 💡 **When You MIGHT Still Use Zapier (Optional)**

Your system handles everything automatically, but you could optionally add Zapier for:

| Use Case | Your System | + Zapier Integration |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Lead Notifications** | ✅ Built-in activity logging | 📱 SMS alerts via Twilio |
| **Data Backup** | ✅ Database storage | 📊 Auto-sync to Google Sheets |
| **Team Notifications** | ✅ Admin dashboard | 💬 Slack/Discord alerts |
| **Email Marketing** | ✅ Contact management | 📧 Mailchimp integration |

**Flow if using Zapier:**
```
Squarespace → Your /api/new-lead → Zapier webhook → Additional actions
```

But honestly, **your direct system is already better** than what most people achieve with Zapier alone.
