# Squarespace Widget: Production Stability Status

You're closing in on production-grade stability. This document captures the current state of your project and what has just been solved.

## Issue Recap: "Failed to Start Conversation"

### 🔎 Root Cause:
The `handlePrechatSubmit()` function was sending a POST request to `/` — the root path — instead of the actual backend endpoint (`/api/new-lead`) responsible for:

*   Creating a new project or conversation.
*   Returning a valid `projectToken`.

Because the `/` route doesn't return JSON, the widget couldn't parse the response, triggering the error.

---

## ✅ Fix Summary:

*   **🛠️ Corrected Endpoint:** The `fetch` endpoint inside `handlePrechatSubmit()` has been corrected to `POST /api/new-lead`.
*   **🔍 Improved Error Handling:** Failed submissions now show status codes and response content for easier debugging.
*   **🔓 CORS Policy:** The policy was already set up correctly for `*.squarespace.com`, so no changes were needed.

---

## 🧪 What to Test Now:

1.  **Submit the "Start a Conversation" form again.**
2.  **Watch the Network tab in DevTools for:**
    *   A `Status 200` response from `/api/new-lead`.
    *   A JSON body containing a `projectToken`.
3.  **Check that:**
    *   The message box appears correctly.
    *   The widget can send a first message and receive replies.
    *   File uploads still work as expected.
4.  **Test new vs. returning clients:**
    *   **New Client:** A new `projectToken` should be created.
    *   **Return Visit:** The widget should reuse the stored token from `localStorage`.

## 🔄 What's Still Outstanding?

If the test works cleanly, the following items are considered resolved:

*   ✅ Messaging widget is **fully functional**.
*   ✅ File previews/downloads are **fixed**.
*   ✅ Pre-chat flow now correctly **connects to the backend**.
