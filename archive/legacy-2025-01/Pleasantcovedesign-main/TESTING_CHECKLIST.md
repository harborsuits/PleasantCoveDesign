# üß™ Pleasant Cove Design - Testing Checklist

## üéØ **SYSTEM OVERVIEW**

**Goal:** Squarespace widget ‚Üí Backend API ‚Üí React Admin UI (localhost:5173)

**Key Files:**
- ‚úÖ **Widget:** `squarespace-widgets/messaging-widget-unified.html`
- ‚úÖ **React UI:** `src/pages/ProjectInbox.tsx` (FIXED API endpoints)
- ‚úÖ **Backend:** `server/routes.ts` (API endpoints working)

---

## üîß **SETUP STEPS**

### 1. Start the System
```bash
# In terminal:
./Pleasant\ Cove\ Launcher.command

# This should start:
# - Backend API on localhost:3000
# - React UI on localhost:5173
```

### 2. Open React Admin UI
- Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173`
- Go to "Project Inbox" page
- Should see list of projects on the left

### 3. Open Widget for Testing
- Open: `squarespace-widgets/messaging-widget-unified.html` in browser
- Should show pre-chat form

---

## ‚úÖ **TESTING CHECKLIST**

### **Phase 1: Basic Connection**
- [ ] React UI loads at localhost:5173
- [ ] ProjectInbox page shows projects list
- [ ] Widget loads and shows pre-chat form
- [ ] Backend API responds to health check: `http://localhost:3000/health`

### **Phase 2: New Session Creation**
- [ ] Fill out widget pre-chat form (name + email)
- [ ] Form submits successfully (no error message)
- [ ] Widget shows messaging interface
- [ ] New project appears in React UI ProjectInbox

### **Phase 3: Client ‚Üí Admin Messaging**
- [ ] Send test message from widget
- [ ] Message appears in React UI ProjectInbox
- [ ] Message shows correct sender name
- [ ] Timestamp is accurate

### **Phase 4: Admin ‚Üí Client Messaging**
- [ ] Select project in React UI ProjectInbox
- [ ] Send reply from React UI
- [ ] Reply appears in widget
- [ ] Reply shows as admin message

### **Phase 5: File Attachments**
- [ ] Upload file from widget
- [ ] File appears in React UI
- [ ] File can be downloaded from React UI
- [ ] Send file from React UI
- [ ] File appears in widget

### **Phase 6: Session Persistence**
- [ ] Refresh widget page
- [ ] Previous messages still visible
- [ ] Can continue conversation
- [ ] React UI still shows all messages

---

## üêõ **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Widget Shows "Failed to start conversation"**
- Check backend is running on localhost:3000
- Check `/api/new-lead` endpoint is working
- Check browser console for errors

### **Messages Don't Appear in React UI**
- Check ProjectInbox is using correct API endpoints
- Check project has valid accessToken
- Check browser console for API errors

### **WebSocket Connection Issues**
- Widget should fall back to HTTP polling
- Check "Connected" status in widget header
- Real-time updates may be delayed but should work

### **File Upload Issues**
- Check file size (10MB limit)
- Check file types (images, PDFs, docs allowed)
- Check uploads directory exists and is writable

---

## üéâ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

**The system is working when:**
1. ‚úÖ Client can start conversation via widget
2. ‚úÖ Messages flow both directions (client ‚Üî admin)
3. ‚úÖ Files can be shared both directions
4. ‚úÖ All messages appear in React UI ProjectInbox
5. ‚úÖ Sessions persist across page refreshes

**Once this works, you can:**
- Embed the widget on your Squarespace site
- Manage all client conversations from localhost:5173
- Handle file sharing seamlessly
- Scale to multiple simultaneous conversations

---

## üìù **NOTES**

- Widget auto-detects environment (localhost vs production)
- React UI uses same backend API as widget
- All data stored in SQLite database
- WebSocket provides real-time updates with HTTP polling fallback
