## 🔍 System Gap Analysis

### ✅ **What's Working Well:**
1. **Messaging System** - Fully integrated, real-time
2. **Order Building** - Complete with pricing
3. **Payment Processing** - Stripe integration working
4. **Lead Management** - Database and tracking solid

### ❌ **Critical Gaps:**
1. **Campaign Management UI** - No way to launch/track outreach
2. **Project Workspace Squarespace Integration** - Not properly modularized
3. **Analytics Dashboard** - No unified view of metrics
4. **Invoice Management UI** - Can't preview/manage invoices
5. **Support System** - No post-launch ticket system

### ⚠️ **Needs Improvement:**
1. **Scraping Controls** - Should be in UI, not command line
2. **Demo Management** - No UI to manage generated demos
3. **Upwork Integration** - Manual process, could be automated
4. **Client Handoff** - No structured process

---

## 🎯 Priority Fixes

### 1. **Modularize Project Workspace** (URGENT)
The project workspace should be a single embed code for Squarespace:
```html
<!-- Single line embed for Squarespace -->
<script src="https://pleasantcovedesign.com/workspace-module.js"></script>
<div id="pleasant-cove-workspace"></div>
```

### 2. **Complete Squarespace Integration**
- Member detection working ✅
- Project isolation by member ✅  
- Canvas integration needed ❌
- Unified experience needed ❌

### 3. **Add Campaign Management**
- Launch outreach from UI
- Track open rates
- Monitor responses
- A/B testing

### 4. **Analytics Dashboard**
- Lead conversion funnel
- Revenue tracking
- Project timelines
- Customer satisfaction
